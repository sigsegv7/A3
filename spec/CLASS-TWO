-- THE A3 PROCESSOR INTERNALS MANUAL --

** Scope **

The scope of this manual is to describe the processor internals to those
assisting with the development of the architecture. This manual is to describe
the hardware interactions and inner-workings. Software interfaces related to the
described elements are not in scope of this manual.

** Arithmetic logic unit **

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a circuit within the processor whose job is to
take two operands and perform a specific operation upon them. The ALU has its own set
of opcodes for the purpose of defragmentation.
