-- THE A3 PROCESSOR INTERNALS MANUAL --

** Scope **

The scope of this manual is to describe the processor internals to those
assisting with the development of the architecture. This manual is to describe
the hardware interactions and inner-workings. Software interfaces related to the
described elements are not in scope of this manual.

** Arithmetic logic unit **

The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a circuit within the processor whose job is to
take two operands and perform a specific operation upon them. The ALU has its own set
of opcodes for the purpose of defragmentation.

(OPCODES)
------------------------------
0x00 : NOP
0x01 : ADD
0x02 : SUB
0x03 : RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE
0x04 : RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE
0x05 : OR
0x06 : AND
0x07 : XOR
0x08 : RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE
------------------------------

** UTAP **

A MicroTap is a standard (by Lunota Software) for multiplexing serial links to various
destinations for the purpose of debugging. Unlike JTAG, it is aimed to be simpler and
easy to set up with a few wires.

(UTAP CONNECTOR PINOUT)
------------------------
SEL[2:0] - Select lines
RX       - Receive line
TX       - Transmit line
------------------------

The select lines allow a specific unit to be selected for
commands. A function preamble is to be bundled with the
data on the TX lines.

(SELECT DOMAINS)
------------------------
0x00  - Reserved
0x01  - Program counter
... RESERVED
